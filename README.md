1. Download the code in a zip file and extract in a folder
2. Delete the build folder, it's useless for local development.
3. Open your terminal(linux or vscode) and cd into the directory where u extracted.
4. Make sure you have node js and npm install in your system.
5. Run the command '$ npm i' to install the dependencies.
6. Run the command '$ npm start' to start a local development server in your default browser.

## Design Perspective

* The design and the theme has been kept dark(mostly black) with gold and whote buttons for contrast.
* The site has various buttons which follow a consistent design, with rounded edges and relatable sizes. 
* The product page also has a dark theme with colorful images(from unsplash) to create the right contrast.
